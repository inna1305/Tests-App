# Tests App
This is a React application that fetches data from a JSON file using the API. The retrieved data is then displayed in a table format, allowing users to click
on each item to navigate to a separate page for more details. The app also features a search functionality,
enabling users to look for specific elements by name, and provides 
sorting options for four different fields.
